# Cloud Architecture Demo

Demo cloud platform showcasing architecture concepts, multi-cloud integration, and platform modularity.  
This is a **non-commercial, educational project** to demonstrate platform engineering principles and platform-as-a-service architecture.

## Project Goals
- Illustrate **core modules**: balance, autocorrection, audit  
- Demonstrate **"reality filtering"** using multi-cloud services  
- Show **phone as entry point** for platform integration  
- Prepare foundation for **AI curator and token system**  
- Serve as a **demo for developer/engineer status verification**

## Repository Structure
- `docs/` — architecture diagrams, concept notes, documentation  
- `core/` — platform core modules  
- `modules/` — reality filtering, token system, AI curators  
- `client/` — phone entry point  
- `api/` — API endpoints and integration stubs
